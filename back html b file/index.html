<h3>MY LOVE CONFESSION</h3>
<em> Hi Nadege i want to wish you a very big happy birthday. i am really happy for your presence in my life.
   i guess santa gave me a christmas gift because i saw yor profile on Xmas day. i want you know you that i really do like you alot and really hope you will give me a chance.
  i was to insecure snd shy to say to it so i chose to do it this way, since i know alitte bit of web-development. whatever your answer is i really want yo say thanks for coming into my life.
